Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`         | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`         | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`       | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`     | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `npm run format`      | Format codes with Prettier                         |

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.

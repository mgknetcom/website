Why WooCommerce?
----------------

WooCommerce is one of the most popular eCommerce platforms out there. With over 30 million active installs, it’s easy to see why. But what makes WooCommerce different from the rest? Let us break down some of the features that make it stand apart from the competition.


WordPress market share versus other CMS-s

### Customizability

One of the biggest reasons people choose WooCommerce is because of how customizable it is. From the theme selection to the checkout flow, everything about your store can be customized to suit your needs. This includes adding additional products, changing colors, adjusting fonts, and even creating multiple stores within one account.

### Extensions

As we mentioned above, WooCommerce offers a large library of extensions to help you customize your store further. There are extensions for things like inventory management, product reviews, social media sharing tools, and much more.

### Payment Gateways

Another great thing about WooCommerce is that it offers a variety of payment gateways. You can use Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree to accept payments. Each of these payment gateways offers unique advantages, such as allowing for recurring billing, integrating into existing systems, and offering discounts based on volume.

### Quite easy-to-use

WordPress and WooCommerce are among the most popular platforms out there. They both offer a wide range of functionality and allow anyone to quickly build a functioning online store. This makes them very attractive for beginners looking to launch their own online shop. But what really sets them apart from other solutions is their ease of use.

Both platforms are extremely simple to install and configure, making them perfect for people with no experience in web design. You can easily select one of the preinstalled themes for your store, customize it according to your needs and start adding products, setting up payment methods and shipping options. If you want to take things further, you can always hire someone else to do the job for you. ([like us](https://mgknet.com/contact-us/)) However, even if you don’t know anything about coding, you can still manage everything manually.

Safety and security are handled well
------------------------------------

WordPress is quite a secular platform although it is often a target of cybercriminals. However, there are many ways you can keep yourself safe from such threats. One way is to install some useful plugins. There are plenty of security plugins available out there that can help you secure your WordPress site. These plugins can help you protect against attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, malware, spam, brute force login attempts, etc. They can even help you detect bots and prevent them from accessing your site. You can find a good number of security plugins here. Some of those plugins also offer features like password strength checkers, anti-spam protection, email notifications, etc.

There are also many WordPress security guides available online that can help you understand how to secure your WordPress site better. For example, WP Security Checklist offers a detailed guide about securing your WordPress site. You can download the checklist here.

Another thing you can do is to follow the regular updates and patches offered by WordPress. This ensures that your site stays protected from potential vulnerabilities. Updates also ensure that your site runs smoothly without being affected by bugs. As mentioned earlier, WordPress releases updates regularly. So, following the release schedule of WordPress helps you stay updated with the latest versions. Finally, you can always rely on community support too.

As we know, WordPress is open-source software. Therefore, anyone can contribute to the development process. If you come across a bug, you can report it to the developers. Also, if you want to suggest a feature, you can do so via GitHub. This makes sure that the community gets involved in making WordPress better.

Search engine friendly
----------------------

In simple terms, search engine optimization is the process of making sure that your website appears high up in search engine rankings. To achieve this goal, you need to optimize your website for keywords related to your products and services. You must ensure that your website loads quickly and provides relevant information to visitors.

Why Do Search Engines Prefer WordPress Websites?

WordPress is one of the most preferred CMS platforms because it offers many features such as plug-ins, themes, and templates. These features allow developers to customize the look and feel of the website without having to pay programmers to develop custom code. Additionally, there are thousands of free themes and premium ones available on the internet. Furthermore, WordPress allows you to add multiple languages to your website. This feature makes it easy for people to translate your website into different languages. In addition, WordPress is open source software meaning that anyone can access the code and modify it according to their needs.

Easy to get support
-------------------

There are many forums dedicated to WordPress and WooCommerce. These include WP Tavern, WPMU DEV, WP Engine Forums, and others. One such forum is Wordcamp Central, which hosts thousands of topics related to the CMS.

The best part about these forums is that you don’t have to pay anything to join. You just need to register yourself and start posting questions.

If you’re looking for help with some specific issue, there are several options. For example, if you want to know how to add a new post, you can ask a question on the relevant topic.

If you’re having trouble adding a product to your cart, you can check out the “Cart & Checkout Issues Forum.” You can also contact the developer directly. They’ll usually respond within 24 hours. Forum posts are public and anyone can view them. So, if you’re looking for a quick solution to a problem, it might be worth checking out what others have posted.

Mobile friendly
---------------

One of the most important things that one needs to consider while choosing a theme for his/her website is whether it is mobile-friendly or responsive. There are different types of sites that are built using the WordPress platform. Some of those include eCommerce sites, blogs, news portals, etc. All of these sites require some form of responsiveness.

In today’s world, we see a lot of traffic coming from smartphones and tablets. These devices are used by people to access the internet. So, it becomes necessary to ensure that your website looks great on such platforms. And if your site does not respond well to mobiles, then you will lose out on a large number of potential customers. Therefore, it is very essential that you understand what a responsive website is and how it works.

The term “responsive design” refers to web pages that automatically resize themselves according to the size of the screen on which they are viewed. Responsive designs adapt to fit the display area of the browser window. They work regardless of the type of device used to view them. For example, a tablet displays a webpage differently from a smartphone. But both use the same browser window. Hence, a responsive design ensures that the layout of a webpage stays intact even if the browser window is resized.

A mobile-friendly website is one that adjusts itself to the screen size of a mobile device. However, a responsive design does not mean that it is always mobile-friendly. Mobile friendliness depends on how much information is displayed on the page. When a website is mobile-friendly, it allows the user to browse the entire site without having to scroll horizontally.

## How do we do it?
Every project, business and team are unique. Our audit process involves interviewing your entire team, from product owners to engineers, analyze your apps and infrastructure hands-on and provide you with the most detailed report.

After we initiate cooperation, the sequence of our joint steps will look something like this:

* We will briefly inspect your infrastructure and application to outline the scope of work and detect the most critical parts
* Then we provide you with a detailed proposal on what needs to be improved and why we think that needs to be improved
* Following the agreed-upon scope of work, we will perform our hands-on audit and assessment.
* As we finish, we provide you detailed with the most detailed full fledged report on how to improve your infrastructure, and give your team tasks that will lead them to the needed result.

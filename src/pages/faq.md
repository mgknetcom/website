### Do you sell our data?

Short answer: No, we don’t play that game.  
Long answer: As everybody on the internet we hate that. That is why this is one of our major rules which we never brake. All our data collected in all our projects or clients will never sell information connected with our clients/visitors.

Long answer: (will be here soon)

Paypal, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.

### Can I change my plan in the middle of the month?

Certainly! If you have a monthly plan, your change will be effective the moment you change it.

Yes. As soon as you cancel your plan, we will disable our automated maintenance systems and will erase your data from our systems. **Please note that we will not refund unused time.**

### What happens if my website is broken when updated?

There are a lot of reasons in which this can happen, it’s possible that a website is “broken” following an update.  
When that happens, we will restore your website to the most recent backup copy before the issue and will let you know.  
If the reason for the problem is judged to be “minor” by our team, we will be glad to correct the issue without additional charge so that your website may benefit from the update.  
However, if a custom plugin or theme causes the issue, additional fees may apply. We’ll let you know, of course, before any work is performed.
